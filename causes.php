        	<h2> Causes </h2>
        	
        	
	        	<h3>Burning fossil fuels</h3> 

	        	<p>When we burn fossil fuels like coal, and gas to create electricity or power our cars, we release CO2 pollution into the atmosphere. Australians are big producers of CO2 pollution compared to the rest of the world. Our level of CO2 pollution per person is nearly double the average of other developed nations and more than four times the world average.</p>

	        	<p>Electricity generation is the main cause of carbon pollution in Australia as 73% of our electricity comes from burning coal and 13% from burning gas. The remaining 14% comes from renewable energy sources such as hydro, solar and wind, which do not emit carbon.</p>
        	
 
        
        	
				<h3>Deforestation</h3>

				<p>Plants play an important role in regulating the climate because they absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen back into it. Forests and bushland act as carbon sinks and are a valuable means of keeping global warming to 1.5Â°C.</p>

				<p>But humans clear vast areas of vegetation around the world for farming, urban and infrastructure development or to sell tree products such as timber and palm oil. When vegetation is removed or burnt, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, contributing to global warming. Up to one-fifth of global greenhouse gas pollution comes from deforestation and forest degradation.</p>
			

			
			<h3>Farming</h3>

				<p>Animals, livestock like sheep and cattle, produce methane, a greenhouse gas. When livestock grazed at a large scale, as in Australia, the amount of methane produced is a big contributor to global warming.</p>

				<p>Some that farmers use also release nitrous oxide, which is another greenhouse gas.</p>
