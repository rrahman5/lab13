## Ontology
The site is centered as an introduction to Global Warming.  Glboal warming has a description, it has an aboutt section to what it is, it has a history of information. It has a Causes section, a Action section talking about the actions that can be taken, and it has a future section that talks about the future of the earth due to Global Warming.
The survey is a sign up form where after reading about Global Warming the reader can sign up to volunteer at the city they live in.

## Taxonomy

- header: We have  header section that is constant throughout the webpage and tells the reader what website is about
- section: We used content blocks for the different sections of each page to separate the content for the readers.
  It is used for the Z pattern we are using for most of the website

- h1: Used this tag in the header section for the title of the website as it tells the user what this website is for
- nav: Used a nav section for the general navigation of the website and contains all the links. Used general best practices for navigation such as <nav> , <li>, <ul> , <href>
- footer: The footer contains information about the sources we took our information from. It clearly tells the reader what it is through the <h2> tag that says Information Sources. It also says the names of the creators of the website so that the readers can see it

  
### Index page
This page uses a F- layout to show the content and guides the user attention to the volunteer sign up
- div: For the image in the center because it is different
  than the outer 4 sections and is not one of the Z layout 
  focal points
- h2: Is used because it is the heading for the content
  in its section but is under the main site heading
- p: is used because it is a paragraph of text under
  the h2 in its section
  
### Survey
  - Form : to create the whole survey structure in a form
  - input : to get user's input for the various fields of the type
  - input type:  to create different types of buttons such as radio button, checkbox, and text.
  The text is for getting general information about the user such as name, email, and a general response on what they think
  about glboal warming. 
  The radio and checkbox is to get information on how the reader feels about certain things on a range of between 1-5, to
  see what the user feels as more relevant information
 
 ### Content Pages
 
 For the content pages we used:
 <h2>tags : To show what the main title of that page is and what its about
  <h3> tags: to show if there are major subpoints under the main title of the page. This is only used for the 
    Causes Page.
<p> tags : For all the content we used this tag to display the information to the user    
  

## Choreography

### Pages
- The optimal experience for the reader is to come to the index page and read the content and then sign up with the volunteer form.
The Z- layout helps with navigating the user's attention to form quickly. Then the reader can take actions to read the content in all the other navigation items and look at the different content.
